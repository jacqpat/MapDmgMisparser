# MapDmgMisparser
WIP

This is a script meant to automate the treatement of MapDamage2.0' Misincorporation.txt files.
This script will be able to parse and transform those files into .csv files, and produce one "resume" csv documenting some important informations in all of those files.
The script will be able to take the files' paths either directly as arguments or indexed in a txt file.
It won't be necessary to give each individual paths as well: the script will look through given folders' to find all the MapDamage sub-directories and the Misincorporation.txt files.
